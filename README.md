# ðŸ“Œ Audit Data Management & Compliance Analysis

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project aims to automate the extraction and analysis of audit reports, creating a structured database to derive valuable insights for businesses and compliance purposes. The database will support various audit types but will include a dedicated module for **ISO 27001 compliance analysis**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Automate** the extraction of audit data from Word documents.
- **Store** structured audit data in a SQL database.
- **Analyze** compliance with different ISO standards.
- **Identify trends** in audit findings (non-conformances, improvements, risks).
- **Develop dashboards** for visualizing audit insights.

## ðŸ“Š Business Insights
By analyzing audit reports, this project will provide:
- **Trend Analysis of Non-Conformances**: Identify the most common compliance failures and track improvements over time.
- **Risk Classification**: Automatically categorize risks based on severity and impact.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare different organizations' compliance levels.
- **Predictive Compliance Analytics**: Forecast potential audit risks before they occur.
- **Corrective Action Effectiveness**: Measure how quickly and efficiently organizations address non-conformances.
